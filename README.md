I've decided to open-source some of my projects as a way of giving back to the software engineering community. These repositories are available under their respective licenses:
- [**MQ-Websocket**](https://github.com/mjedari/mq-websocket) *– a lightweight WebSocket application that works with message queues written in GoLang.*
- [**Canary**](https://github.com/mjedari/canary) *– a responsive, production-ready modern UI application written in Vue.js & Nuxt.js frameworks.*

These projects, along with the libraries I’ve intentionally developed for open-source use cases, are my way of contributing to the tools we all rely on.


🧩 Projects Built for Companies (Task-Based Work)
Below are selected projects developed as part of tasks or trial assignments for companies. While many of these were built under specific requirements or time constraints, they reflect my practical approach and problem-solving skills:

[**API Crawler**](https://github.com/mjedari/canary)

*This project was a prototype of the implementation of a simple api crawler, designed to fetch data and create a short-link.*
  
[**Task Processing System**](https://github.com/mjedari/canary)

*This is a task processing system using microservices and RabbitMQ. The system consists of three components: a producer, a task distributor, and multiple workers.*

[**Health Check System**](https://github.com/mjedari/canary)

*API Health Checker based on Clean Architecture.*
